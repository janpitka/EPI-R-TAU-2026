# What does R offer for epidemiologists?

-   Dynamic publication ecosystem
-   Descriptive tools
    -   Versatile tabulation
    -   High-quality graphics
-   Analytic methods
    -   Basic epidemiologic statistics
    -   Generalized linear models and their extensions
    -   Event History/Survival analysis methods
    -   Other ...

These are provided by SAS and Stata, too, so why R?

Many features of R are more appealing in the long run.

# R ecosystem

-   The R language (R)

-   R package system (CRAN)

-   Development tool/environment (RStudio)

-   Dynamic documentation/publishing (quarto)

# 

# CRAN - R community

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   CRAN is a collection of packages

-   Packages  (20 000+) are collections of new commands/functions, that are developed and shared by the worldwide R userbase.

-   base R containes several package and operations

-   If your needs are unmet by base R, there’s likely a package for it

-   In epidemiology most useful packages are survival and Epi.

-   Entire ecosystems of packages exist (*Tidyverse)*

# Rstudio - script development

``` r
```

# Quarto - dynamic publishing

-   **Quarto** is an open-source system designed for creating interactive and reproducible documents. Here are some key points about Quarto:

-   **Markdown-Based**: Quarto documents are authored using Markdown, making it easy to format text and include code and visualizations.

-   **Versatile Output**: You can generate documents in various formats, including HTML, PDF, and presentations.

-   **Integration**: Quarto supports integration with RStudio, and other editors, allowing for a seamless authoring experience.

-   **Dynamic Reports**: You can create dynamic reports and interactive dashboards using Quarto, making it suitable for scientific and technical writing.

# Writing dynamic publication using R

# R language - data types

Data objects of different kinds

-   **vector**: ordered set of similar elements

    real numbers or character sequences

-   **factor:** categorical variable with levels

    gender, levels: c(1,2) or c('male', 'female')

-   **matrix, array**: 2- and k-dimensional tables

-   **data.frame**: "data matrix" (more of this soon!)

-   **list:** sequence of different types of objects.
