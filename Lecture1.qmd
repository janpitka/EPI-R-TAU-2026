# What does R offer for epidemiologists?

-   Dynamic publication ecosystem
-   Descriptive tools
    -   Versatile tabulation
    -   High-quality graphics
-   Analytic methods
    -   Basic epidemiologic statistics
    -   Generalized linear models and their extensions
    -   Event History/Survival analysis methods
    -   Other ...

These are provided by SAS and Stata, too, so why R?

Many features of R are more appealing in the long run.

# R ecosystem

-   The R language (R)

-   R package system (CRAN)

-   Development tool/environment (RStudio)

-   Dynamic documentation/publishing (quarto)

# R language - basis

# CRAN - R community

-   Packages are collections of new commands, a.k.a. functions, that are developed and shared by the worldwide R userbase.

-   base R containes 15 packages

-    While [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) is the most popular package archive for R tools.

-   Functions and packages are developed in response to identified needs

-   If your needs are unmet by base R, there’s likely a package for it

-   Altogether, there are more than 20,000 packages on CRAN, alone

-   In epidemiology most useful packages are survival and Epi.

-   There are tens of thousands of unpublished packages

-   Entire ecosystems of packages exist (*Tidyverse)*

# Rstudio - script development

# Quarto - dynamic publishing

-   **Quarto** is an open-source system designed for creating interactive and reproducible documents. Here are some key points about Quarto:

-   **Markdown-Based**: Quarto documents are authored using Markdown, making it easy to format text and include code and visualizations.

-   **Versatile Output**: You can generate documents in various formats, including HTML, PDF, and presentations.

-   **Integration**: Quarto supports integration with RStudio, and other editors, allowing for a seamless authoring experience.

-   **Dynamic Reports**: You can create dynamic reports and interactive dashboards using Quarto, making it suitable for scientific and technical writing.
